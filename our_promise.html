<div class="maintext">We started this page as people who want to bring more sustainability to our everyday lives.<br> 
    One of the places we are starting is in how we source our fashion.<br>
    Through research we have found some brands that weâ€™d like to explore; each with a different style.<br>
</div>

<div class="maintext">If you are browsing the site and have come across a sustainable brand that you love,<br> 
    but is not mentioned site-wide, please let us know by filling in the details of the brand:<br>
     socials, links to their online shop, features in magazines etc. 
</div>

<div class="maintext">
    This way the word gets round and we can grow our reach to all sustainable brands, big or small.
